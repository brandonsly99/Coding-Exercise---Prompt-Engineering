        "5) It could be slightly more concise in wording while still meeting the length requirement.\n",

        "In 2024, several cities expanded electric bus programs to reduce local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Transit agencies reported that electric buses can lower fuel and maintenance costs over time, but they also noted that the upfront purchase price is higher than diesel models. Agencies identified charging infrastructure and grid capacity as major bottlenecks, especially when many buses need to recharge overnight, and some cities planned charging during off-peak hours to reduce strain on the grid. Riders generally described trips as quieter. Operators also emphasized the need for technician training and careful route planning because cold weather and steep routes can reduce driving range."
